    - A computer program which is a command line interpreter (not compiled).
    - A shell script includes operations to be performed like file manipulation, program execution and printing text.
- A shell file has an extension .sh
- sh - Bourne shell which was used for Unix
- BASH - Bourne Again Shell
- check your bash location : `which bash`,  outputs to `/usr/bin/bash`

## Basic Commands in Shell
- `cd` -> change directory
    - `cd c:\Revature\MyRepo`
    - if your folder has space in between the use the path within quotes
        - `cd "c:\Revature\My Repo"`
- `mkdir` - make a new directory
- `rmdir` - remove a directory
- `touch` - command to create a new file
- `clear` - to clear the screen
- `echo` - to output a string
- `ls` -  to list output files in the current directory
- `ls -l` -  to list output files in the current directory in long listing format.
    - Format includes file type, file permissions, number of hard links to the file, file owner, file soze, file group, date and time, file name
    - file permissions include 
        - `r` - Permission to read the file
        - `w` - Permission to write the file
        - `x` - Permission to execute the file
        - Ex `rw-r--r--` means that user can read and write the file and the group and others can only read the file.
- `ls -la` - long listed format of the file including hidden files
